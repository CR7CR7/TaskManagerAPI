A simple Flask-based REST API for managing tasks. Built with Python and SQLite.

## ðŸ§ª Test Coverage

The tests in this project ensure that the core functionalities of the Task Manager API work correctly. Covered features include:

- âœ… Creating a task (POST `/tasks`)
- âœ… Retrieving all tasks (GET `/tasks`)
- âœ… Updating a task by ID (PUT `/tasks/<id>`)
- âœ… Deleting a task by ID (DELETE `/tasks/<id>`)
- âœ… Handling invalid requests (e.g. missing title, non-existent ID)

Total: **5 automated tests using Python `unittest`**, located in the `test/` directory.

All tests pass successfully and cover both standard and edge-case scenarios.
